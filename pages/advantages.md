# Key Advantages of APIs

Integrating with APIs will bring multiple benefits to your team. Integrated solutions measurably improve both your company’s business  and development processes. 

Here is a selection of the benefits you can enjoy:

## Better Business Processes

### Increased Efficiency:
Our API can significantly increase the efficiency of your existing business processes. Instead of entering the same data in multiple systems, enter it once and let our API do the work for you. Free up the time your employees spend on repetitive and potentially dull tasks and let them focus on more high value work.
### Increased Accuracy:
When your business processes involve multiple individuals entering data into multiple systems, it’s easy for inaccuracies to sneak in. By using APIs to eliminate data re-entry, you can prevent inconsistencies between records. Regular synchronisation routines also ensure that the data in up to date.
### Increased Flexibility:
With APIs you are not confined to one way of working as you can tailor solutions to meet your needs. How you share data between systems can be customised to meet your specific business requirements. Let the needs of your sector or preferred manner of business organisation determine how you access data.

## Better Development Process

### Shared Knowledge:
AccountsIQ has an open API strategy, meaning that anyone can write software that is compatible with our system and each time we create an integration with a development partner, it’s available for everyone. The more people that use our services, the more this knowledge base grows.
### Faster, More Flexible Development:
Your developers don’t have to build a solution from scratch. Instead, they can employ our specialised ready-made options. Additionally, because AIQ API can be used with any programming language and platform it can be adapted to meet the preferences of your development team.
### Streamlined, Easier to Maintain End-Products:
Let our API handle complexity in the background instead of your developers creating overly complex products, with features that slow them down. The results will also be far easier to maintain as your developers don't have to maintain updates. Any improvements we make will be passed on to you.
