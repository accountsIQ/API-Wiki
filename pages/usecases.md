# Business Use Cases
Learn about some of the most common use cases for our API.

## Use Case 1: Transaction Management
Any business, especially those with high volumes of sales, can benefit from using our API to manage transactions. Instead of wasting time with double-entry, schedule transactions to flow automatically from your chosen EPOS into AIQ. 

Decide how you want to manage transactions, including invoices, sales receipts, and allocations. Bring in settlement receipts such as cash, credit, or loyalty cards to AIQ. Within our system, you can then use our integrations to settle these receipts with the bank.

### Integration Partner Example:
Our integration with [Salesforce](https://www.accountsiq.com/features/integrations/salesforce/) lets you create sales orders based on closed opportunities within their system. The integration works both ways. Payments taken via Salesforce pass to AIQ. In addition, sales staff can access customer balances and statuses added by the finance team, meaning everyone has the most up-to-date records.

## Use Case 2: Business Analysis
Integrating with sophisticated business analysis software can help any company see better if they are meeting their business goals. Use our API to pull data from AIQ into your preferred analysis software to produce live dashboards, enhanced with your business line data.

Viewing all your relevant data in one place, broken down according to your industry’s requirements, will give you a better picture of where your company is at performance-wise. You can then use this information to strategise about all relevant aspects of your business, saving you time and money.

### Integration Partner Example:
Users of Oracle’s [Opera](https://www.accountsiq.com/features/integrations/opera/), a hospitality management system, can pull invoices from AIQ, gaining invaluable business management data. They can use AIQ data to break down income down by rooms, conference facilities, or food and drinks.

## Use Case 3: Tax and Payroll Automation
Let our API to assist you with your routine business obligations, from tax payment to managing your payroll, and more. With API automation, you can ensure that your business runs smoothly and stays compliant, as well as make significant time savings.

With the advent of Making Tax Digital (MTD) in the UK, APIs are now central to the tax and VAT return process. UK businesses can reduce the burden of tax reporting by submitting financial information from AIQ to HMRC in one easy move.

You can also minimise payroll administration by integrating a specialised third-party system with AIQ. The payroll system can be set up to pull the appropriate employee details from the AIQ accounts.

### Integration Partner Example:
Our integration with [BrightPay](https://www.accountsiq.com/features/integrations/brightpay/) lets you automate the payroll process by mapping each payroll item to the relevant account. You can manage the payroll, automate payments including tax calculations, publish payslips, and more.

## Use Case 4: Approval Management
Enjoy a smoother expenses approval process by integrating your existing process with AIQ. Any documents you upload to your preferred third-party approval system can then automatically flow into AIQ. In AIQ the data is then extracted which sets off the pre-defined approval process. 

Using APIs to automate approval will save you a significant amount of administration time, ensure all records are in agreement, and eliminate the need for physical paperwork.

### Integration Partner Example:
Our [Expensify](https://www.accountsiq.com/features/integrations/expensify/) integration lets you photograph, upload, and record expenses in their application, then pulls the data into AIQ to complete the process.

## Use Case 5: Work/Project Management
Integrations let you simplify the otherwise complex process of business management, both in terms of manual administration and decision making. When you integrate your management software with AIQ, you can directly relate your financial data to your work and project goals. 

Data can flow between systems, so you always have the most up-to-data data available. Plan workflows so that your timesheets fit within your budget goals. 

### Integration Partner Example:
The integration between AccountsIQ and [Joblogic](https://www.accountsiq.com/features/integrations/joblogic-integration/) allows an easier and more efficient way to manage finances, combining the benefits of both an accounting system and a powerful service management software.
