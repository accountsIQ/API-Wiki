# Authentication 2.0

## Login Requirements WSDL 2.0

The newest version of our API, comes with a new endpoint, and a simplified login experience with OAuth 2.0 authentication.

Our API management has also been streamlined. Within our system, customer administrators can create and manage integration applications and invite developers to the new Developer Portal. None of this requires AIQ or developer assistance. In the Developer Portal, developers can manage their APIs.

To learn more, including migrating from our older endpoints, see the links below.
